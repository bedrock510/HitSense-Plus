    "### 🧠 Why Linear Regression is Easier to Interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Random Forest model performed better in terms of prediction accuracy (lower MSE), **Linear Regression remains valuable for its interpretability**. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Straightforward Coefficients**  \n",
    "   - Each feature has a numeric coefficient that tells you **how much it affects popularity**.\n",
    "   - For example:  \n",
    "     `popularity = 1.2 × danceability + 0.8 × energy − 0.5 × acousticness + ...`  \n",
    "     This lets us say:  \n",
    "     > “For each unit increase in danceability, the popularity score increases by ~1.2, assuming all other features stay the same.”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Hidden Logic**  \n",
    "   - Linear Regression uses a simple, direct equation.\n",
    "   - There are no decision trees, no branching, no black-box behavior — just a line fitted to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transparency for Stakeholders**  \n",
    "   - Easy to explain to non-technical audiences.\n",
    "   - Ideal for business presentations, where it's important to **justify predictions** with clear, cause-and-effect logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Baseline Benchmark**  \n",
    "   - Even if it's not the most accurate model, Linear Regression provides a **useful baseline** for understanding the dataset and testing future models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **Random Forest** is an ensemble of many decision trees. While it's often more accurate, it can be difficult to interpret why a prediction was made, and which feature influenced the outcome most in any single prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ✅ In summary:  \n",
    "> Use **Linear Regression** when you need clarity.  \n",
    "> Use **Random Forest** (or other complex models) when accuracy matters more than explainability.\n"
